# Tidy_Noses
You analysis is only as good as your data, which can be the bane of data scientists’ existences. We are creating programs that will take raw data from common Robotic Olfaction machines (including electronic noses, tandem mass spectrometry, and gas chromotography ion mobility spectroscopy) and  automatically “tidy” the data into a universally usable format. This will aide in data accessibility, streamline future data pipelines, and assist less data-savvy researchers in their analyses.

Scripts batch convert raw e-Nose/GC-IMS/MSMS data files into "tidy" formats where every row is an observation and every column is a variable. Scripts do not modify original files.
