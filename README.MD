# Tidy_Noses
These scripts take raw data from common Robotic Olfaction machines (including electronic noses, tandem mass spectrometry, and gas chromotography ion mobility spectroscopy) and  automatically “tidy” the data into a universally usable format. This aids in data accessibility, streamlines data pipelines, and assists less programming-savvy researchers in their analyses.

Scripts batch convert raw e-Nose/GC-IMS/MSMS data files into "tidy" formats where every row is an observation and every column is a variable. Scripts do not modify original files.
